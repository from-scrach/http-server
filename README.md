# Introduction
This is the code accompanying [this blog post](https://www.fromscratch.sh/an-http-server-part-1/).

# Branches
Every part's code has been saved as a branch and the `master` branch is the
current (latest) code. As we get more parts in the series, you can checkout
individual branches to get the code to that specific part.
